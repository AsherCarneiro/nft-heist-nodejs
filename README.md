## Requirements
- Node.js 15 or higher

```
cd nft-heist
```
```
npm i
```
```
node . <username>
```

## Why aren't some users working?
To be honest; I don't know. I don't know much about OpenSea or NFTs, all I know is if the url looks like this: `https://opensea.io/collection/<username>` then it will work. Otherwise, it will not. But you can still try it.
